# Getting started

## Editing and running online

* [Stackblitz](http://stackblitz.com/github/clinth/ixfx-demos-light)
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ClintH/ixfx-demos-light)
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ixfx-demos) (code editing experience not the best)

## Editing and running locally

There are two versions of the demo repository.

* _ixfx-demos_ includes a copy of ixfx. This is useful for working offline and the recommended approach. 
* _ixfx-demos-light_ is a mirror of this, without the ixfx build and with all sketches using a online, hosted version of ixfx. This is useful when using a web-based IDE.
