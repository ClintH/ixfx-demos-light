# ixfx-demos-light

## Getting started

* [If you are editing files locally](./local-machine.md)
* [If you are editing files on a web host such as Stackblitz](./remote-machine.md)

## Editing

Edit demos under `src`. You can mix and match Javascript and Typescript files.

There is a build process that copies them to `docs` - but do not edit them there since they will get overwritten.
