# ixfx-demos-light

## Getting started

* [I want to run a server on my computer and edit locally](./local-machine.md)
* [I want to run things on the cloud](./remote-machine.md)

## Editing

Edit demos under `src`. You can mix and match Javascript and Typescript files.

Do not edit any files under `docs`. These are automatically produced from what is in `src`.
