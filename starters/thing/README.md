# thing

## thing

Demonstrates decoupling of thing state with the sketch state, having its own update logic and visual expression.

Things to try:
* Have the thing slowly drift down the screen, the speed determined by mass
* Using another input, calculate an 'updraft' value which pushes element up
* Make the element draggable, updating the `position` property
